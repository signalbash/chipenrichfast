CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.4
-------------------------

  o Streamlined some code that expected result of read_bed() to be a list of IRanges
    from very early in development.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.3
-------------------------

  o Fixed a minor bug where the dependent variable used in the enrichment model
    was used to name the rows of the enrichment results. This could be confusing
    for users. Now, rownames are simply integers.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.2
-------------------------

  o Fixed bug in randomization with length bins where artifactually, randomizations
    would sort genes on Entrez ID introducing problems in Type I error rate.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.4
-------------------------

PKG FEATURES

  o Back-end refactoring of the code base.

    o Break out functions in main.R into .R files collecting similar functions.

    o Transition documentation to roxygen2 blocks.

    o Improve commenting in chipenrich() function.

  o Assigning peaks using GenomicRanges object rather than than list of IRanges.

  o Rewrite package vignette in Rmarkdown and render with knitr.

  o Improve supported_*() functions to report and check combinations of genome,
    organism, genesets, locusdef, and mappability read length.

  o Cleanup DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE to avoid loading entire packages.

  o Follow data() best practices.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
------------------------

PKG FEATURES

  o A new method, broadenrich, is available in the chipenrich function which is
    designed for gene set enrichment on broad genomic regions, such as peaks resulting
    from histone modificaiton based ChIP-seq experiments.

  o Methods chipenrich and broadenrich are available in multicore versions (on every
    platform except Windows). The user selects the number of cores when calling
    the chipenrich function.

  o Peaks downloaded from the ENCODE Consortium as .broadPeak or .narrowPeak files
    are supported directly.

  o Peaks downloaded from the modENCODE Consortium as .bed.gff or .bed.gff3 files are
    also supported directly.

  o Support for D. melanogaster (dm3) genome and enrichment testing for GO terms
    from all three branches (GOBP, GOCC, and GOMF).

  o New gene sets from Reactome (http://www.reactome.org) for human, mouse, and rat.

  o New example histone data set, peaks_H3K4me3_GM12878, based on hg19.

  o New locus definitions including: introns, 10kb within TSS, and 10kb upstream of TSS.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0
----------------------

PKG FEATURES

  o chipenrich performs gene set enrichment tests on peaks called from
    a ChIP-seq experiment

  o chipenrich empirically corrects for confounding factors such as
    the length of genes and mappability of sequence surrounding genes

  o Use multiple definitions of a gene "locus" when testing for enrichment,
    or provide your own definition

  o Test for enrichment using chipenrich or Fisher's exact test (should only
    be used for datasets where peaks are close to TSSs, see docs)

  o Test multiple sets of genesets (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Biocarta, OMIM, etc.)

  o Multiple plots to describe binding distance and likelihood of a peak
    as a function of gene length

  o Support for human (hg19), mouse (mm9), and rat (rn4) genomes

  o Many conveniences such as seeing which peaks were assigned to genes,
    their position relative to those genes and their TSS, etc.

  o See how many peaks were assigned to each gene along with the length and
    mappability of the gene


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated examples for various functions to be runnable (removed donttest)
  o Updated DESCRIPTION to use Imports: rather than Depends:
  o Updated license to GPL-3
  o Updated NEWS file for bioconductor guidelines

BUG FIXES

  o Added a correction for the case where a small gene set has a peak in
    every gene. This has the result of making a very few number of tests
    slightly conservative, at the benefit of actually being able to return
    a p-value for them.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Minor updates to documentation for Bioconductor

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Initial submission to Bioconductor

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.6
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Added peaks per gene as a returned object / output file

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.5
------------------------

BUG FIXES

  o Update to handle bioconductor/IRange's new "functionality" for distanceToNearest and distance

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Changed sorting of results to put enriched terms first (sorted by p-value), then depleted (also sorted by p-value)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.4
------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Minor changes to vignette and documentation

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Addition of rat genome

BUG FIXES

  o chipenrich() will correctly open both .bed and .bed.gz files now

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Added ability for user to input their own locus definition file (pass the full path to a file as the locusdef argument)
  o Added a data frame to the results object that gives the arguments/values passed to chipenrich, also written to file *_opts.tab
  o For FET and chipenrich methods, the outcome variable can be recoded to be >= 1 peak, 2 peaks, 3 peaks, etc. using the num_peak_threshold parameter
  o Added a parameter to set the maximum size of gene set that should be tested (defaults to 2000)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Previously only peak midpoints were given in the peak --> gene assignments file, now the original peak start/ends are also given
  o Updated help/man with new parameters and more information about the results

BUG FIXES

  o Fixed an issue where status in results was not enriched if the odds ratio was infinite, and depleted if the odds ratio was exactly zero

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Added a QC plot for expected # of peaks and actual # of peaks vs. gene locus length. This will be automatically created if qc_plots is TRUE, or the plots can be created using the plot_expected_peaks function.
  o Distance to TSS is now signed for upstream (-) and downstream (+) of TSS
  o Column added to indicate whether the geneset is enriched or depleted

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Added support for reading BED files natively

BUG FIXES

  o Fixed bug where invalid geneset in chipenrich() wasn't detected properly

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8
----------------------
BUG FIXES

  o Fixed crash when mappability contained an NA (will be removed from DB in future version)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7
----------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated binomial test to sum gene locus lengths to get genome length and remove genes that are not present in the set of genes being tested
  o Updated spline fit plot to take into account mappability if requested (log mappable locus length plotted instead of simply log locus length)
  o Removed SAMPLEABLE_GENOME* constants since they are no longer needed
  o Updated help files to reflect changes to plot_spline_length and chipenrich functions

BUG FIXES

  o Fixed bug where results for multiple gene set types (e.g. doing BioCarta and KEGG together) were not sorted by p-value

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6
----------------------

BUG FIXES

  o Fixed bug where 1kb/5kb locusdefs could fail if not all peaks were assigned to a gene

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5
----------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated help to explain new mappability model
  o Changed how mappability is handled - now multiplies gene locus length by mappability, rather than adjusting as a spline term
